Package lookup service for Bower.

## Usage
Plook is a HTTP server that does package and version lookup in the Bower registry and, if the file
is hosted in GitHub, it will print the contents of that file with the right mime type.

The requests format is the following:

```
http://<plook-server>/<package>/<version>/<file-path>
```

where:  
- `<plook-server>` is the address of a running Plook server;
- `<package>` is the name of a package registered in the Bower registry, like `jquery` or `angular`.
  The package name must be URL encoded if it contains special chars (like `/`).
- `<version>` is the targeted package version, like `1.0.0` or `v2.1.0`. The `v` prefix will be
  ignored.
- `<file-path>` is the path to the file you want to print, like `foobar.css` or `foobar/baz/qux.js`.

We have an online server running in http://plook.injoin.io so that you can use it freely with the
main Bower registry.

## Running and testing Plook
Plook requires only that [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [NPM](http://npmjs.org) are installed on
your system.  
Please ensure you have them before continuing on this tutorial.
 
1. Clone this repository on your computer:
   
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/injoin/plook.git
   ```
2. Next, install NPM dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```
   
3. Finally, run the plook service:
   
   ```bash
   $ npm start
   ```
   
4. In the case you're developing Plook, test your modifications with:
   
   ```bash
   $ npm test
   ```
   
The service will run in the port `3000` by default, but you can easily override this by setting a
`PORT` env var.

## Running Plook on your own
If you want to, you are free to run your Plook instance. However, we just require that you inform us
about it.  
_If you are willing to do so, please get in touch via __hello [at] injoin.io__._
